# Terminal Development Setup

Whilst the majority of programmers these days opt for to use intelligent IDE's like VSCode or JetBrains, there still exists a love for retro coding in a terminal window. Here I provide a sync for my `rc` files (Run Commands) which I will run on start up for any new machine. The main components of my setup are:

- **Neovim** with Copilot support
- **tmux**

Programming in the terminal offers superior advantage in efficency. The slowest process in programming is moving your fingers from your keyboard to your mouse. With this setup you should be able to browse files, edit code, run code and analyse results all with keeping your hands tied to the keyboard. There is a learning curve and that can be a bit of a challenge, but I haven't met any programmer who doesn't enjoy a challenge ;)

# Setup

This is meant to be a simple, easy-to-use repository. Simply clone it and then run
